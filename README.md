## Project Status
This is currently a ***WORK IN PROGRESS (WIP)***. Please note that because of this, certain features *may **not** perform its intended behavior* or *content may be missing*. Here is a list of tasks I intend to implement by this project's completion:
- Snazzier web design 
- More interactions (rather than just reading based)
- Implementation of CSS Grid for better support on multiple screen sizes
